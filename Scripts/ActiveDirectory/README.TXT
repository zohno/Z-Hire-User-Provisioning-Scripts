GENERAL USAGE NOTES
--------------------

- Before copying all the files to our local system we need to pass 1 parameter to the script which will ne the SamAccountName. After that   you have to give the destination profile path and destination home path where the script will copy the data.

- You can directly mention the destination path values in the sigle quote (Like: 'C:\Users\DELL\Desktop') and run the script.
