Hi Denny,

As per your requirements I made the script to enable/disable the GoToMeeting user. I have attached 2 text files with this mail. One is to set the user disable and next one to set the user to enable.

Now we no need to fetch the Access Token from the developer tool website. I found the easy way to get the Access Token by passing the Domain User Name and Password as an first 2 arguments. From the credentials of GotoMeeting first it gets the Access Token then use that token next to disable the user.

Now these script takes 3 arguments total. First domain User Name, second password and third email id of the user which you want to make it disable.

We need 2 dlls for it. CitrixGotoUserAPI.dll which is used to disable the user and Newtonsoft.json.dll which is responsible to de-serialize the object of user. I also added the comments in the script itself.

Please test both the scripts at your end and let me know if you want any change/modification in it. Both scripts are working fine at my end and I can give Demo if you need.

Let me know your comments.

Thanks
